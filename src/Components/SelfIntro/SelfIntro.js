              Technology introduced itself to me a while ago. And when I decided
              to study programming, I fell in love! And, of course, for
              everything she has to offer me and me to offer her.

              <br /> For the past 8 months, I have often studied many hours a
              day. And about 3 months ago, I got my first internship, at
              Avanade.
